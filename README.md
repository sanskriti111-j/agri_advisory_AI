# agri_advisory_AI
agri_advisory_AI  is a locally executed, AI-powered farm advisory system built entirely in Python using Visual Studio Code. It uses a modular multi-agent framework to simulate expert agricultural decision-making without requiring internet or cloud infrastructure.
All development and testing were done in VS Code, with CSV files as input, Python scripts for agent logic, and Ollama-powered LLaVA for image-based plant disease detection. The system includes a terminal-based advisory runner (run.py) and an optional Streamlit app (app.py) for a simple web interface.

The project integrates:

A Farmer Advisor that suggests suitable crops based on soil, water, and fertilizer inputs

A Market Researcher that analyzes demand, pricing, and trends from market-level CSVs

A Yield Predictor that estimates expected crop yield

A Vision-based Disease Detector using Ollama + LLaVA for leaf image diagnosis

All agents are orchestrated in a controller and executed from the terminal or UI

No cloud services were used. All logic and models run locally, making the system accessible and replicable in low-resource rural environments.

‚úÖ Built With

Visual Studio Code (development environment)

Python 3 (core logic, data processing)

Streamlit (optional UI)

Ollama + LLaVA (on-device LLM + vision model)

CSV files (input data)

Here's a breakdown of how the system works:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1: Input Farm ID

The user enters a Farm_ID (like F001) in the terminal or Streamlit app.

This Farm_ID is used to fetch all the relevant farm-level data from a CSV file (farmer_advisor_dataset.csv), such as:

Soil type (Loamy, Sandy, Clay)

Water availability (High, Medium, Low)

Fertilizer used (Organic, None, Synthetic)

Crop grown last season

This makes the system dynamic and personalized for each farm.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2: Load Market Data

The system also loads a separate market-level CSV (market_researcher_dataset.csv) that contains:

Products (e.g., Wheat, Rice, Corn)

Demand Index, Market Price, Competitor Price

Seasonal and Economic indicators

This helps the Market Researcher agent assess which crops are profitable and in demand.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Step 3: Agent Collaboration (Modular Logic)

Each agent performs a specific role independently:

üë®‚Äçüåæ Farmer Advisor
Analyzes soil, water, and fertilizer conditions to recommend crops that are agronomically suitable.

üìà Market Researcher
Calculates demand trends, pricing, and competitiveness. It highlights which crops are most profitable.

üåæ Yield Predictor
Estimates the potential yield (in tons per acre) based on farm inputs like soil quality and water availability.

üñºÔ∏è (Optional) Disease Detector
If provided with a plant image, the system uses Ollama + LLaVA to analyze the image and describe visible symptoms or diseases.

All of these agents are modular ‚Äî they run independently and return their conclusions to the main controller.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Step 4: Final Advisory Summary

The controller agent aggregates the results from all agents and builds a final advisory message. It includes:

Recommended crops

Predicted yield

Market demand and pricing overview

Past crop usage for context
